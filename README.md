This is My Magic Trick. You will start by putting a number between 0 and 15 in your head. Got one? Good, now on the next screen, you’ll have a set of a few cards Card A through Card D, if you’re number is on the set of cards, than input yes, if it’s not input no. 


For Test Mode the Yes and nos on Card A  through Card D will already be populated and you will have to guess the number between 0-15 based on the yes and no’s.
