User gets to pick what game they want to play (Magic or Miner) or they can quit.
If they pick Miner it runs them through a tutorial on hhow the game works and tells them to buy one miner.
They can keep waiting for money, go to the shop or retire.
If they go to the they will see a menu of items to buy or they can go to back and earn more money.
If they choose to retire it displays your money and your multiplier and it prints it in a txt document.
If they later decide to play again they can pick up where they left off.
